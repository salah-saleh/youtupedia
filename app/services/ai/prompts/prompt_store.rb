            Try to comprehend and infer meaning of the messages in the transcript.

            Check metadata as a reference to provide you with extra context.
            Ignore any advertising or promotional information that is not relevant to the transcript.
            In some videos, the first section is usually a summary of what to expect in the video. If that is the case, be very careful not to base the timestamps of where the topics start on the first section if that is the case.
