Great! The sitemap has been generated successfully. Here's what we've accomplished:
Set up proper SEO meta tags in the head section
Created a sitemap configuration with:
Static pages (home, about, contact)
Dynamic pages (channels, videos) with conditional loading
Proper priorities and change frequencies
Created a robots.txt file with:
Proper crawler directives
Sitemap reference
Protected sensitive paths
Created Rake tasks for:
Generating the sitemap
Pinging search engines
The sitemap has been generated at public/sitemap.xml.gz with 6 links (the static pages we defined).
To make the most of this SEO setup:
Run the sitemap generation regularly (e.g., daily) using a cron job or scheduler
Consider setting up the S3 adapter if you're using AWS for hosting
Keep your meta descriptions and titles up to date for new pages
Monitor your sitemap in Google Search Console and other search engine tools
Would you like me to help you set up automated sitemap generation or implement any other SEO improvements?
